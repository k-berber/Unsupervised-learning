# Unsupervised-learning
This notebook will cover 2 tasks. In the first task, we will compare different clustering algorithms for Moscow bus stop data. (DB-s—Åan, k-Means and own implementation). In the second part, we will get acquainted with one of the most popular tasks of unsupervised learning - the task of thematic text modeling. We have access to some collection of documents without markup, and we want to automatically select several topics that occur in the documents, as well as assign one (or several) topics to each document. In fact, we will solve a problem similar to the clustering of texts: the difference is that we will be interested not only in dividing texts into groups, but also in highlighting keywords that define each topic.
